ng-jackspa has been written under a GNU/Linux OS but should work under other
UNIX flavours.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

The official source for release downloads is at
<http://download.gna.org/ngjackspa/>.  The dependencies to build the package
have to be installed first (see <<dependencies, Dependencies>> below).

To install directly from the sources' tree, download a release archive and
extract it.  The quick and simple way to install ng-jackspa with documentation
in your home directory +~/.local+ is to run:

[source,sh]
$ make .help
$ make
$ make install install-doc

To adjust the installation process (as well as the build process) set Makefile
variables on the command line:

[source,sh]
$ make CFLAGS='-g -O2 -fstack-protector'
$ make install prefix=$HOME/.local/stow/ngjackspa

Distributors might use the +DESTDIR+ Makefile variable to install the files for
packaging:

[source,sh]
$ make install DESTDIR=./packagefiles

Documentation building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To avoid the installation of the documentation tool chain, pre-compiled
documentation files are available in the release archives.  To force the
re-building of the documentation, delete the files first:

[source,sh]
$ make distclean doc

Verifying the signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need to have the
link:https://gna.org/project/memberlist-gpgkeys.php?group=ngjackspa[GnuPG key]
of the packager.

[source,sh]
$ gpg --keyring ngjackspa-keyring.gpg -v ngjackspa-${version}.tar.gz.sig
