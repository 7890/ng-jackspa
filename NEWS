Release Notes for ng-jackspa version/1.0
----------------------------------------

This is the first release of ng-jackspa, a forked continuation of
link:http://code.google.com/p/jackspa/[jackspa].

Updates since the original jackspa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New

  - New interfaces were added: ncurses, Qt and command line.
  - The interfaces are more elaborate, allowing one to easily switch between
    two sets of control values and to reset the controls to their default
    values, which is convenient for testing LADSPA plugins.
  - A UNIX manual page ng-jackspa(1) was added.
  - The LADSPA plugin can be specified by its label in addition to its UID.
  - Several command line switches are now implemented, notably to set the
    initial values or to override the default values given by the plugin.
  - Automatically start a JACK server (if it is not already running).
  - Several jackspa instances of the same plugin can be run simultaneously by
    letting JACK generate a new client name if the default one is already used.
  - The control inputs/outputs can be exported as control voltages on JACK
    audio ports and connected to each other using standard JACK connection
    managers; JACK peak meters can be used to visualize the control port
    values.  (In jackspa only the control outputs were exported to JACK.)

* New documentation files: README, BUGS, INSTALL, NEWS.


Fixes since the original jackspa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

jackspa was found to be fully functional, although a lot of code cleanup and
many fixes could be made.  For a complete list of fixes see the VCS' history.

* Most notable fixes

  - Do not export output control ports as JACK audio ports by default.
  - Accept a client name modified by JACK (if the one provided is already in
    use).
  - Search the `$LADSPA_PATH` for plugin libraries.
  - The graphical interfaces have scrollbars if the window size becomes too
    small.
